        I created the original version of this app as my first project as a
        student with Flatiron School. I wanted to create a project that was easy
        to use, demonstrated my abilities as a Software Engineer, and also
        provide a product that a recruiter or HR team might find useful. I then
        refactored this app using React and added a few additional features for
        my second project.
